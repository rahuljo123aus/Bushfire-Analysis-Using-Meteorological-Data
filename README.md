# Bushfire-Analysis-Using-Meteorological-Data

### Objective: 
Analyze various factors leading to the Bushfires and predict the area burnt by the Bush Fires.

#### The various tasks in the project are:

#### Exploratory Data Analysis: 
Summarizing the main characteristics of data visually using R-programming language. Also, identifying the important factors which determine the area burnt.

#### Data Preparation: 
Performing various transformations on data to gain Normality.

#### Model Building and Comparison: 
Building a wide range of Linear and Non-Linear Models to predict the area burnt. Moreover, using high level metrics to compare the models.
